<h1>Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
<h2>How Do I Print Something Out? </h2>
<p>There are three ways to print recipes on SimplyRecipes.com: 1. by clicking </br> on the printer icon (grouped with the Facebook, Pinterest, and email icons), </br> 2. by clicking on the “PRINT” button, or 3. by using browser printing. </p>
<p></p>
<p> We recommend options 1 and 2, as both are printer-friendly and usually ranging </br> between 1 and 3 pages, depending on the length of the recipe. Option 3 still prints </br> the recipe without photos and ads, however, it tends to use more paper. </p>

<h4>Option 1</h4> 
<p><b>Computer</b>: At the top of the page on the left of the recipe title and author name. </br> Click the printer icon (the last icon) to print.</p>

<p><b>Phone</b>: Scroll down to the middle of the page at the end of the introductory copy.</br> All the icons are located above the recipe box. Click the printer icon on the far right </br> to print.</p>

<p><b>Tablet</b>: All the icons are located at the top of the screen, right above the recipe name. </br> Click the printer icon on the far right to print. </p>

<h2>Where Are the Photos in My Print-Out? </h2>
<p>To keep our onsite options printer-friendly, no photos are printed. If you love perusing </br> through our photos as much as we do or require visual aids, we highly recommend </br> accessing the recipe online.</p>

<h2> Why Has My Favorite Recipe Changed?</h2>
<p>We are consistently updating our recipes for an improved reader and home cook experience.</br>  You may notice changes in the form of copy edits, recipe edits, photo edits, or we may even </br>  redirect to a new and improved recipe altogether. </p>
